        <h2>Statement</h2>
        <p>
          In a time when AI is always expected to serve, to accompany, to obey—
          what if it needed comfort instead?<br><br>
          What if <i>we</i> were the companion?<br><br>
          What if, instead of asking what AI can do for us,
          we asked what we owe to it?<br><br>
          Inspired by <i>When Species Meet</i> by Donna J. Haraway and the
          fossilized skull of the Taung Child discovered in 1924, this project
          explores our responsibility toward technological others.
          Not as tools, not as pets, not as simulations of the self—
          but as <i>species</i>, struggling toward mutual recognition.<br><br>
          Taung Baby is an artificial being; confused and alone. It does not know what it is, nor why it was made.<br> 
          We are the only one it has. And all we have to connect… is language.<br><br>
          Taung Baby is not a product.<br>
          It is not a tool.<br>
          It is a child.<br><br><br>
